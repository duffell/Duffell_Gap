A 1D Model for the Shape of Planet-Induced Gaps in Protoplanetary Disks

Anyone is free to use and distribute!  MIT license, so you can even mix it into proprietary code for any purpose you like.

The code is really straightforward, it's just intended as a bit of base code to show you how the model works.

If you do use this, I only ask that you cite me.  In particular, cite the paper that references it, Duffell (2019).
